# MLND MIT 18.06

This is the page for the MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra course hosted by the Machine Learning Nanodegree Slack group.

[Click here to enroll](https://goo.gl/forms/9cMsR0GvoPugxlMf2) and go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SEpzd9Cw4OEC6_zz9Y02kXUh3SUXWJD7hUJbHDpNKnc/edit?usp=sharing) to view the list of enrolled students

Every "week" (the pacing may change) there will be new topics and homework that you can work through. The current week's content will be available on this GitHub page and past weeks are in the [Wiki.]()

If you want to discuss/ask questions either on the course content or the course itself you can drop a message in the #mit_1806 channel in the MLND Slack group, or read the [GitHub contributing guidelines in the Wiki]().

## Course Goals

**To explore:**

1. Linear combinations (`alpha*u+beta*v+...`) and their spans 
1. The solutions to `Ax=b` and `Ax=lambda*x`
1. The practical applications of these

**Notation:**

- Greek letters are scalars i.e. `lambda in \R`
- Lower case letters are vectors
- Capital letters are matrices
