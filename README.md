# MLND MIT 18.06

This is the page for the MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra course hosted by the Machine Learning Nanodegree Slack group.

[Click here to enroll](https://goo.gl/forms/9cMsR0GvoPugxlMf2) and go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SEpzd9Cw4OEC6_zz9Y02kXUh3SUXWJD7hUJbHDpNKnc/edit?usp=sharing) to view the list of enrolled students

Every "week" (the pacing may change) there will be new topics and homework that you can work through. The current week's content will be available on this GitHub page and past weeks are in the [Wiki.]()

### Discussion/Questions

If you want to discuss or ask any questions, you can either drop a message in the #mit_1806 channel in the MLND Slack Group, or open an GitHub "issue" at the top of the page (we treat these like forum threads). Please label your thread with the correct tags so that people can find what they are looking for.

Don't be shy to ask any questions, we don't bite and the chances are that someone else is wondering about the same thing! :)

## Course Goals

**To explore:**

1. Linear combinations (`alpha*u+beta*v+...`) and their spans 
1. The solutions to `Ax=b` and `Ax=lambda*x`
1. The practical applications of these

**Notation:**

- Greek letters are scalars i.e. `lambda in \R`
- Lower case letters are vectors
- Capital letters are matrices
